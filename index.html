	<!-- <h2>Research Interest</h2> -->
	<p> I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.chosunbabylab.com/">Chosun Babylab</a> at the Chosun University in Gwangju, Korea </p></a>
	<p> My research focuses on unraveling the learning mechanisms of early language development in young children. By using multiple methods like eye-tracking, naturalistic recordings, and corpus analysis, I investigate early language learning comprehensively to examine the factors shaping early language acquisition. </p>
	<p> To better track language development, I develop innovative, <a href="https://github.com/junhochai/BabyLex2.0">adaptive assessments using Bayesian IRT </a> models during my PhD. These brief, browser-based tests provide insights into children's linguistic abilities for targeted interventions. </p>
	<p> During my free time, I enjoy swimming, playing tennis and hanging out with my family. </p>
