	<!-- <h2>Research Interest</h2> -->
	<p> My research focuses on unraveling the learning mechanisms of early language development in young children. By using multiple methods like eye-tracking, naturalistic recordings, and corpus analysis, I investigate early language learning comprehensively to examine the factors shaping early language acquisition. </p>

	<p> To better track language development, I develop innovative, adaptive assessments using Bayesian IRT models during my PhD. These brief, browser-based tests provide insights into children's linguistic abilities for targeted interventions. </p>
